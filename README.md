# Police-Database-Project[without password hashing]

Firstly,there you are.I dont know how you get there but this is my first project using git version control system on github.

## Installation for who hasnt learned any things about git commands.

To clone my project, first open your terminal and use [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Be sure to change your directory to the correct location before running the clone command, so you don't clone the repository into the wrong place.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osmanerenq/My-Police-Database-Project.git
```
To install and run a mongodb server(database) on your computer,please install [MongoDb Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and use this command:
```bash
mongod --port 24353(whatever you want) --dbpath C:/Server(Directory of The Server) --auth(authentication if you want)
```
After that you must open a terminal for shell of mongodb too.Use command:
```bash
mongosh --port 24353 (whatever you want) 
```
